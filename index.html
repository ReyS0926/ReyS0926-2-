    <p>I come from a family chasing the American dream. As a young boy, I witnessed the lifestyle changes that coming to America made for my family. 
        I wanted to thank our country for the opportunities it gave me, and, at age seventeen, I joined the United States Marine Corps.</p>
    <p>While in the Marine Corps I learned logistics and earned my college degree in Criminal Justice. In 2005 I deployed to Iraq where I was responsible 
        for the supporting the logistics related to rations for all members of our armed forces in the western part of the country. In my civilian career, 
        being fluent in English and Spanish has allowed me to serve a diverse client base. I have worked in nearly every department within a high-volume law 
        firm including: Operations, Intakes, Investigations, Case Management, and Negotiations. </p>
